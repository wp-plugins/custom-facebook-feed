The Custom Facebook Feed allows you to display a customizable Facebook feed of any public Facebook page or group on your website.

== Description ==

The Custom Facebook Feed allows you to display a customizable Facebook feed of any public Facebook page or group on your website. Other Facebook plugins are Facebook branded and as they use iframes they don't allow you to customize the look, feel and functionality yourself. The Custom Facebook Feed is 100% customizable and by default inherits your theme's style.

To display photos and videos in your feed try out a demo of the PRO version on the [Custom Facebook Feed website](http://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/demo "Custom Facebook Feed Demo").

== Installation ==

1. Install the Custom Facebook Feed either via the WordPress plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your web server (in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to the plugin settings page to configure your feed.
4. Use the shortcode `[custom-facebook-feed]` in your page, post or widget to display your feed.
5. You can display multiple feeds of different Facebook pages by specifying a Page ID directly in the shortcode: `[custom-facebook-feed id=SarahsBakery show=5]`.
